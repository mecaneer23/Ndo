How to implement a buffer:
- store buffer as a string/(maybe list) (to be filled up with characters)
- buffer is nonlocal
- when function is called, add to buffer
- if buffer.is_full() or char == "\n": output buffer and empty buffer 

how do we determine if the buffer is full?
- it can have an arbitrary length
- it can have a set length based on a percentage of the width of the window
- we can store a counter and check how many calls the function has recieved and use an arbitrary amount of calls
