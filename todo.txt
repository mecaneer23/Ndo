-r fix: strikethrough in curses
  -r fix long lines (longer than width // 2 - 1)
  -r fix moving down onto a toggled line
-m fix: make startup faster
  -m depends on how the program is run, not a huge issue
-y feat: add unit tests?
-b feat: use [ and ] to fold/unfold
  -b needs movement adjustment
  -b in _updates_cursor if pos + count > len(todos) IndexOutOfBounds error
  -b how can we save folded state when todos are pulled from file and list is recreated?
- refactor: simplify redundancy between _get_display_string and _print_todo (strikethrough)
- fix: reimplement acurses support for windows
- fix: if holding down a key in acurses, make sure it doesn't stay pressed longer than it should (i.e. holding j key) (only reproducible in some terminals)
- feat!: migrate get_todo from keypad(0) to keypad(1) using a large dict similar to the one in main() in todo.py
- fix: artifacting when using arrow keys in acurses with keypad off (namely when get_todo box is open)
