-r fix: strikethrough in curses
  -r fix long lines (longer than width // 2 - 1)
  -r fix moving down onto a toggled line
-m fix: make startup faster
  -m depends on how the program is run, not a huge issue
-y feat: add unit tests?
-b feat: use [ and ] to fold/unfold
  -b in _updates_cursor if pos + count > len(todos) IndexOutOfBounds error
  -b needs movement adjustment
  -b how can we save folded state when todos are pulled from file and list is recreated?
-c fix: if holding down a key in acurses, make sure it doesn't stay pressed longer than it should (i.e. holding j key) (only reproducible in some terminals)
  -c happens because there is too much delay between actions. You can press keys faster than the program can respond
-c fix: visual glitch when len(todos) == 1 in acurses
- feat!: implement bcurses (browser-curses) using brython
- fix: select all todos above/below should be predictable and repeatable
- fix: odd behavior when undoing line join
  - steps to replicate?
