  -b how can we save folded state when todos are pulled from file and list is recreated?
-g feat: add multiple line paste operation for in-app copy
  -g migrate copied_todo to list of todos
-c fix: reimplement acurses support for windows
-c fix: if holding down a key in acurses, make sure it doesn't stay pressed longer than it should (i.e. holding j key) (only reproducible in some terminals)

- feat!: implement bcurses (browser-curses) using brython
- docs: add list of input box controls to README
- fix: select all todos above/below should be predictable and repeatable
